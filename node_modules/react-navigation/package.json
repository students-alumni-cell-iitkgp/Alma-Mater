It guides you through the fundamentals of React Navigation.\n* The documentation includes solutions for common use cases in the \"How do I do ...?\" section, such as [tab navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation.html) and [Redux integration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/redux-integration.html).\n* If you need to build your own navigator, [there's a section for that](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/custom-navigator-overview.html) too.\n* The [API reference](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/api-reference.html) lists all public APIs.\n* The [Community Resources](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/master/COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md) document lists some other resources submitted to us by people who use React Navigation. Feel free to open a pull request to add your resource to the list.\n* You can contribute improvements to the documentation [in the website repository](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).\n\n## Try it out\n\nYou can also try out the [Navigation Playground app](https://exp.host/@react-navigation/NavigationPlayground) to get a sense for some of the tools built in to React Navigation. The \"Fundamentals\" in the documentation also include examples you can play with.\n\n## FAQs\n\n#### I'm having troubles using the library, what can I do?\n\nSee [the help page](https://reactnavigation.org/en/help.html).\n\n#### How can I help?\n\nThis library is a community effort: it can only be great if we all help out in one way or another! If you feel like you aren't experienced enough using React Navigation to contribute, you can still make an impact by:\n\n* Responding to one of the open [issues](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues). Even if you can't resolve or fully answer a question, asking for more information or clarity on an issue is extremely beneficial for someone to come after you to resolve the issue.\n* Creating public example repositories or [Snacks](https://snack.expo.io/) of navigation problems you have solved and sharing the links in [Community Resources](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/master/COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md).\n* Answering questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=react-navigation).\n* Answering questions in our [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/) channel.\n* Providing feedback on the open [PRs](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pulls).\n* Providing feedback on the open [RFCs](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs).\n* Improving the [website](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).\n\nIf you would like to submit a pull request, please follow the [Contributors guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/contributing.html) to find out how. If you don't know where to start, check the ones with the label [`good first issue`](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/labels/good%20first%20issue) - even [fixing a typo in the documentation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/2727) is a worthy contribution!\n\n#### Is this the only library available for navigation?\n\nCertainly not! There other libraries - which, depending on your needs, can be better or worse suited for your project. Read more in the [alternative libraries](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/alternatives.html) documentation, and read React Navigation's [pitch & anti-pitch](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/pitch.html) to understand the tradeoffs.\n\n#### Can I use this library for web?\n\nWeb support was [not a priority for the 1.0 release](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/2585#issuecomment-330338793), but the architecture of this library allows for it (and it has worked in the past). If you would like to lead this charge, please reach out with your ideas for how to move forward on the [RFCs repository](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs) and we would be happy to discuss.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThis library has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n## License\n\nReact-navigation is licensed under the [BSD 2-clause \"Simplified\" License](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/LICENSE).\n",
