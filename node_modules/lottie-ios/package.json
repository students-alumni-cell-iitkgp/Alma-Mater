Change the color, position or any keyframable value!\nLottie also supports native UIViewController Transitions out of the box!\n\nHere is just a small sampling of the power of Lottie\n\n![Example1](_Gifs/Examples1.gif)\n![Example2](_Gifs/Examples2.gif)\n\n<img src=\"_Gifs/Community 2_3.gif\" />\n\n![Example3](_Gifs/Examples3.gif)\n\n![Abcs](_Gifs/Examples4.gif)\n\n## Installing Lottie\n\n### Github Repo\nYou can pull the [Lottie Github Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/) and include the Lottie.xcodeproj to build a dynamic or static library.\n\n### Cocoapods\nGet [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)\nAdd the pod to your podfile\n```\npod 'lottie-ios'\n```\nrun\n```\npod install\n```\n\nAfter installing the cocoapod into your project import Lottie with\nObjective C\n`#import <Lottie/Lottie.h>` \nSwift\n`import Lottie`\n\n### Carthage\nGet [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n\nAdd Lottie to your Cartfile\n```\ngithub \"airbnb/lottie-ios\" \"master\"\n```\nrun\n```\ncarthage update\n```\n\nIn your application targets “General” tab under the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag and drop lottie-ios.framework from the Carthage/Build/iOS directory that `carthage update` produced.\n\n## iOS Sample App\n\nClone this repo and try out [the Sample App](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/tree/master/Example)\nThe repo can build a macOS Example and an iOS Example\n\nThe iOS Example App demos several of the features of Lottie\n\n![Example 1](_Gifs/iosexample1.png)![Example 2](_Gifs/iosexample2.png)\n![Example 3](_Gifs/iosexample3.png)\n\nThe animation Explorer allows you to scrub, play, loop, and resize animations.\nAnimations can be loaded from the app bundle or from [Lottie Files](http://www.lottiefiles.com) using the built in QR Code reader.\n\n## macOS Sample App\n\nClone this repo and try out [the Sample App](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/tree/master/Example)\nThe repo can build a macOS Example and an iOS Example\n\n![Lottie Viewer](_Gifs/macexample.png)\n\nThe Lottie Viewer for macOS allows you to drag and drop JSON files to open, play, scrub and loop animations. This app is backed by the same animation code as the iOS app, so you will get an accurate representation of Mac and iOS animations.\n\n\n## Objective C Examples\n\n\nLottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL\nTo bundle JSON just add it and any images that the animation requires to your target in xcode.\n\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\"];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n  // Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nIf you are working with multiple bundles you can use.\n\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\" inBundle:[NSBundle YOUR_BUNDLE]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n  // Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nOr you can load it programmatically from a NSURL\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [[LOTAnimationView alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:URL]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n```\n\nLottie supports the iOS `UIViewContentModes` aspectFit, aspectFill and scaleFill\n\nYou can also set the animation progress interactively.\n```objective-c\nCGPoint translation = [gesture getTranslationInView:self.view];\nCGFloat progress = translation.y / self.view.bounds.size.height;\nanimationView.animationProgress = progress;\n```\n\nOr you can play just a portion of the animation:\n```objective-c\n[lottieAnimation playFromProgress:0.25 toProgress:0.5 withCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n  // Do Something\n}];\n```\n## Swift Examples\n\nLottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL\nTo bundle JSON just add it and any images that the animation requires to your target in xcode.\n\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"LottieLogo\")\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play{ (finished) in\n  // Do Something\n}\n```\n\nIf your animation is in another bundle you can use\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"LottieLogo\" bundle:yourBundle)\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play()\n```\n\nOr you can load it asynchronously from a URL\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(contentsOf: WebURL)\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play()\n```\n\nYou can also set the animation progress interactively.\n```swift\nlet translation = gesture.getTranslationInView(self.view)\nlet progress = translation.y / self.view.bounds.size.height;\nanimationView.animationProgress = progress\n```\n\nOr you can play just a portion of the animation:\n```swift\nanimationView.play(fromProgress: 0.25, toProgress: 0.5, withCompletion: nil)\n```\n\n## iOS View Controller Transitioning\n\nLottie comes with a `UIViewController` animation-controller for making custom viewController transitions!\n\n![Transition1](_Gifs/transitionMasked.gif)\n![Transition2](_Gifs/transitionPosition.gif)\n\nJust become the delegate for a transition\n\n```objective-c\n- (void)_showTransitionA {\n  ToAnimationViewController *vc = [[ToAnimationViewController alloc] init];\n  vc.transitioningDelegate = self;\n  [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:NULL];\n}\n```\n\nAnd implement the delegate methods with a `LOTAnimationTransitionController`\n\n```objective-c\n#pragma mark -- View Controller Transitioning\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented presentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting sourceController:(UIViewController *)source {\n  LOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition1\" fromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\" toLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\" applyAnimationTransform:NO];\n  return animationController;\n}\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed {\n  LOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition2\" fromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\" toLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\" applyAnimationTransform:NO];\n  return animationController;\n}\n\n```\n\nBy setting `applyAnimationTransform` to YES you can make the Lottie animation move the from and to view controllers. They will be positioned at the origin of the layer. When set to NO Lottie just masks the view controller with the specified layer while resepecting z order.\n\n## Debugging\nLottie has a couple of debugging features to know about. \nWhen an animation is loaded unsupported features are logged out in the console with their function names.\n\nIf you checkout LOTHelpers.h you will see two debug flags. `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` and `ENABLE_DEBUG_SHAPES`. \n`ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` increases the verbosity of Lottie Logging. It logs anytime an animation node is set during animation. If your animation if not working, turn this on and play your animation. The console log might give you some clues as to whats going on.\n\n`ENABLE_DEBUG_SHAPES` Draws a colored square for the anchor-point of every layer and shape. This is helpful to see if anything is on screen.\n\n### Keypaths\n\nLOTAnimationView provides `- (void)logHierarchyKeypaths` which will recursively log all settable keypaths for the animation. This is helpful for changing animationations at runtime.\n\n## Adding Views to an Animation at Runtime\n\nNot only can you [change animations at runtime](#changing-animations-at-runtime) with Lottie, you can also add custom UI to a LOTAnimation at runtime.\nThe example below shows some advance uses of this to create a dynamic image loader.\n\n## A Dynamic Image Loading Spinner\n\n![Spinner](/_Gifs/spinner.gif)\n\nThe example above shows a single LOTAnimationView that is set with a loading spinner animation. The loading spinner loops a portion of its animation while an image is downloaded asynchronously. When the download is complete, the image is added to the animation and the rest of the animation is played seamlessly. The image is cleanly animated in and a completion block is called.\n\n![Spinner_Alt](/_Gifs/spinner_Alternative.gif)\n\nNow, the animation has been changed by a designer and needs to be updated. All that is required is updating the JSON file in the bundle. No code change needed!\n\n![Spinner_Dark](/_Gifs/spinner_DarkMode.gif)\n\nHere, the design has decided to add a 'Dark Mode' to the app. Just a few lines of code change the color of the animation at runtime.\n\n\nPretty powerful eh?\n\nCheck out the code below for an example!\n\n```swift\n\nimport UIKit\nimport Lottie\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n  \n  var animationView: LOTAnimationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"SpinnerSpin\");\n  \n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    \n    // Setup our animaiton view\n    animationView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFill\n    animationView.frame = CGRect(x: 20, y: 20, width: 200, height: 200)\n\n    self.view.addSubview(animationView)\n    // Lets change some of the properties of the animation\n    // We arent going to use the MaskLayer, so lets just hide it\n    animationView.setValue(0, forKeypath: \"MaskLayer.Ellipse 1.Transform.Opacity\", atFrame: 0)\n    // All of the strokes and fills are white, lets make them DarkGrey\n    animationView.setValue(UIColor.darkGray, forKeypath: \"OuterRing.Stroke.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n    animationView.setValue(UIColor.darkGray, forKeypath: \"InnerRing.Stroke.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n    animationView.setValue(UIColor.darkGray, forKeypath: \"InnerRing.Fill.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n    \n    // Lets turn looping on, since we want it to repeat while the image is 'Downloading'\n    animationView.loopAnimation = true\n    // Now play from 0 to 0.5 progress and loop indefinitely.\n    animationView.play(fromProgress: 0, toProgress: 0.5, withCompletion: nil)\n    \n    // Lets simulate a download that finishes in 4 seconds.\n    let dispatchTime = DispatchTime.now() + 4.0\n    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: dispatchTime) {\n      self.simulateImageDownloaded()\n    }\n  }\n  \n  func simulateImageDownloaded() {\n    // Our downloaded image\n    let image = UIImage(named: \"avatar.jpg\")\n    let imageView = UIImageView(image: image)\n\n    // We want the image to show up centered in the animation view at 150Px150P\n    // Convert that rect to the animations coordinate space\n    // The origin is set to -75, -75 because the origin is centered in the animation view\n    let imageRect = animationView.convert(CGRect(x: -75, y: -75, width: 150, height: 150), toLayerNamed: nil)\n    \n    // Setup our image view with the rect and add rounded corners\n    imageView.frame = imageRect\n    imageView.layer.masksToBounds = true\n    imageView.layer.cornerRadius = imageRect.width / 2;\n    \n    // Now we set the completion block on the currently running animation\n    animationView.completionBlock = { (result: Bool) in ()\n      // Add the image view to the layer named \"TransformLayer\"\n      self.animationView.addSubview(imageView, toLayerNamed: \"TransformLayer\", applyTransform: true)\n      // Now play the last half of the animation\n      self.animationView.play(fromProgress: 0.5, toProgress: 1, withCompletion: { (complete: Bool) in\n        // Now the animation has finished and our image is displayed on screen\n        print(\"Image Downloaded and Displayed\")\n      })\n    }\n    \n    // Turn looping off. Once the current loop finishes the animation will stop \n    // and the completion block will be called.\n    animationView.loopAnimation = false\n  }\n  \n}\n\n```\n\n## Changing Animations At Runtime\n\nLottie can do more than just play beautiful animations. Lottie allows you to **change** animations at runtime.\n\n### Say we want to create 4 toggle switches.\n![Toggle](_Gifs/switch_Normal.gif)\nIts easy to create the four switches and play them:\n\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView.frame.origin.y = 20\nanimationView.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView.play()\n\nlet animationView2 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView2)\nanimationView2.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView2.frame.origin.y = animationView.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView2.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView2.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView2.play()\n\nlet animationView3 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView3)\nanimationView3.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView3.frame.origin.y = animationView2.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView3.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView3.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView3.play()\n\nlet animationView4 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView4)\nanimationView4.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView4.frame.origin.y = animationView3.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView4.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView4.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView4.play()\n\n```\n### Now lets change their colors\n![Recolored Toggle](_Gifs/switch_BgColors.gif)\n```swift\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.green, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView3.setValue(UIColor.red, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView4.setValue(UIColor.orange, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n[animationView2 setValue:[UIColor greenColor] forKeypath:@\"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\" atFrame:@0];\n```\nThe keyPath is a dot separated path of layer and property names from After Effects.\nLOTAnimationView provides `- (void)logHierarchyKeypaths` which will recursively log all settable keypaths for the animation.\n![Key Path](_Gifs/aftereffectskeypath.png)\n\"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\"\n\n### Now lets change a couple of properties\n![Multiple Colors](_Gifs/switch_MultipleBgs.gif)\n```swift\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.green, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.red, forKeypath: \"BG-Off.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n```\n\nLottie allows you to change **any** property that is animatable in After Effects. If a keyframe does not exist, a linear keyframe is created for you. If a keyframe does exist then just its data is replaced.\n\n## Animated Controls and Switches\n\n![Animated Buttons](_Gifs/switchTest.gif)\n\nLottie also has a custom subclass of UIControl for creating custom animatable interactive controls.\nCurrently Lottie has `LOTAnimatedSwitch` which is a toggle style switch control. Tapping on the switch plays either the On-Off or Off-On animation and sends out a UIControlStateValueChanged broadcast to all targets. It is used in the same way UISwitch is used with a few additions to setup the animation with Lottie.\n\nYou initialize the switch either using the conveneince method or by supplying the animation directly.\n\n```\n// Convenience\nLOTAnimatedSwitch *toggle1 = [LOTAnimatedSwitch switchNamed:@\"Switch\"];\n \n// Manually \nLOTComposition *comp = [LOTComposition animationNamed:@\"Switch\"];\nLOTAnimatedSwitch *toggle1 = [[LOTAnimatedSwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];\n[toggle1 setAnimationComp:comp];\n```\n\nYou can also specify a specific portion of the animation's timeline for the On and Off animation.\nBy default `LOTAnimatedSwitch` will play the animation forward for On and backwards for off.\n\nLets say that the supplied animation animates ON from 0.5-1 progress and OFF from 0-0.5:\n\n```\n/// On animation is 0.5 to 1 progress.\n[toggle1 setProgressRangeForOnState:0.5 toProgress:1];\n\n/// Off animation is 0 to 0.5 progress.\n[toggle1 setProgressRangeForOffState:0 toProgress:0.5];\n```\n\nAlso, all LOTAnimatedControls add support for changing appearance for state changes. This requires some setup in After Effects. Lottie will switch visible animated layers based on the controls state. This can be used to have Disabled, selected, or Highlighted states. These states are associated with layer names in After Effects, and are dynamically displayed as the control changes states.\n\nLets say we have a toggle switch with a Normal and Disabled state. In Effects we have a composition that contains Precomps of the regular \"Button\" and disabled \"Disabled\" states. They have different visual styles.\n\n![Regular](_Gifs/switch_enabled.png)\n![Disabled](_Gifs/switch_disabled.png)\n\nNow in code we can associate `UIControlState` with these layers\n\n```\n// Specify the layer names for different states\n[statefulSwitch setLayerName:@\"Button\" forState:UIControlStateNormal];\n[statefulSwitch setLayerName:@\"Disabled\" forState:UIControlStateDisabled];\n\n// Changes visual appearance by switching animation layer to \"Disabled\"\nstatefulSwitch.enabled = NO;\n\n// Changes visual appearance by switching animation layer to \"Button\"\nstatefulSwitch.enabled = YES;\n```\n\n## Supported After Effects Features\n\n### Keyframe Interpolation\n\n---\n\n* Linear Interpolation\n* Bezier Interpolation\n* Hold Interpolation\n* Rove Across Time\n* Spatial Bezier\n\n### Solids\n\n---\n\n* Transform Anchor Point\n* Transform Position\n* Transform Scale\n* Transform Rotation\n* Transform Opacity\n\n### Masks\n\n---\n\n* Path\n* Opacity\n* Multiple Masks (additive, subtractive and intersection)\n\n### Track Mattes\n\n---\n\n* Alpha Matte\n\n### Parenting\n\n---\n\n* Multiple Parenting\n* Nulls\n\n### Shape Layers\n\n---\n\n* Anchor Point\n* Position\n* Scale\n* Rotation\n* Opacity\n* Path\n* Group Transforms (Anchor point, position, scale etc)\n* Rectangle (All properties)\n* Eclipse (All properties)\n* Multiple paths in one group\n* Even-Odd winding paths\n* Reverse Fill Rule\n\n#### Stroke (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Stroke Color\n* Stroke Opacity\n* Stroke Width\n* Line Cap\n* Dashes (Now Animated!)\n\n#### Fill (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Fill Color\n* Fill Opacity\n\n#### Trim Paths (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Trim Paths Start\n* Trim Paths End\n* Trim Paths Offset\n\n### Repeaters\n\n---\n\n* Supports repeater transforms\n* Offset currently not supported.\n\n### Gradients\n\n---\n\n* Support for Linear Gradients\n* Support for Radial Gradients\n\n### Polystar and Polygon\n\n---\n\n* Supported!

Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engineering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right.\n2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, Keyframes doesn't support some of Lottie's features such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more.\n2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens.\n3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up.\n\n## Why is it called Lottie?\nLottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) – the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years\n[The art of Lotte Reineger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvU55CUw5Ck&feature=youtu.be)\n\n## Contributing\nContributors are more than welcome. Just upload a PR with a description of your changes.\n\nIf you would like to add more JSON files feel free to do so!\n\n## Issues or feature requests?\nFile github issues for anything that is unexpectedly broken. If an After Effects file is not working, please attach it to your issue. Debugging without the original file is much more difficult. Lottie is developed and maintained by [Brandon Withrow](mailto:brandon.withrow@airbnb.com).
