Be aware that sliders' layouts will break on RTL devices since support was added in version 2.1.0 (see [#38](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/38)).\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel](https://i.imgur.com/Fope3uj.gif)\n![react-native-snap-carousel](https://i.imgur.com/WNOBYfl.gif)\n![react-native-snap-carousel](https://i.imgur.com/sK5DKaG.gif)\n\n> Please note that **we do not plan on Open-Sourcing the code of our showcase app**. Still, we've put together [an example](#example) for you to play with, and you can find some insight about our map implementation [in this comment](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/11#issuecomment-265147385).\n> The folks at [codedaily.io](https://codedaily.io) have created a great tutorial about implementing a similar feature. [Go check it out!](https://codedaily.io/tutorials/9/Build-a-Map-with-Custom-Animated-Markers-and-Region-Focus-when-Content-is-Scrolled-in-React-Native)\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save react-native-snap-carousel\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport Carousel from 'react-native-snap-carousel';\n\nexport class MyCarousel extends Component {\n\n    _renderItem ({item, index}) {\n        return (\n            <View style={styles.slide}>\n                <Text style={styles.title}>{ item.title }</Text>\n            </View>\n        );\n    }\n\n    render () {\n        return (\n            <Carousel\n              ref={(c) => { this._carousel = c; }}\n              data={this.state.entries}\n              renderItem={this._renderItem}\n              sliderWidth={sliderWidth}\n              itemWidth={itemWidth}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Important note regarding Android\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel android](https://i.imgur.com/03iuB2Um.jpg)\n\nAndroid's debug mode is a mess: timeouts regularly desynchronize and scroll events are fired with some lag, which completely alters the inner logic of the carousel. **On Android, you *will* experience issues with carousel's behavior when JS Dev Mode is enabled, and you *might* have trouble with unreliable callbacks and loop mode when it isn't**. This is unfortunate, but it's rooted in various flaws of `ScrollView`/`FlatList`'s implementation and the miscellaneous workarounds we had to implement to compensate for it.\n\n:warning: **Therefore you should always check if the issue you experience also happens in a production environment. This is, sadly, the only way to test the real performance and behavior of the carousel.**\n\n> For more information, you can read the following notes: [\"Android performance\"](#android-performance) and [\"Unreliable callbacks\"](#unreliable-callbacks).\n\n## Props, methods and getters\n\nYou can find the dedicated documentation [here](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/PROPS_METHODS_AND_GETTERS.md).\n\n## Layouts and custom interpolations\n\n### Built-in layouts\n\nIn version `3.6.0`, we've added two new layouts on top of the original one: the first one is called 'stack' since it mimics a stack of cards, and the other one is called 'tinder' since it provides a Tinder-like animation.\n\nYou can choose between the three of them using [the new prop `layout`](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/PROPS_METHODS_AND_GETTERS.md#style-and-animation) and you can modify the default card offset in the 'stack' and 'tinder' layouts with [prop `layoutCardOffset`](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/PROPS_METHODS_AND_GETTERS.md#style-and-animation)]\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel default layout](https://i.imgur.com/e1WbZcu.gif)\n```javascript\n<Carousel layout={'default'} />\n```\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel stack layout ios](https://i.imgur.com/c7pU4rT.gif)\n![react-native-snap-carousel stack layout android](https://i.imgur.com/AnruacR.gif)\n```javascript\n<Carousel layout={'stack'} layoutCardOffset={`18`} />\n```\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel tinder layout ios](https://i.imgur.com/D9QyTzb.gif)\n![react-native-snap-carousel tinder layout android](https://i.imgur.com/ab1TI4e.gif)\n```javascript\n<Carousel layout={'tinder'} layoutCardOffset={`9`} />\n```\n\nA few things worth noting:\n* As you can see, the effect had to be inverted on Android. This has to do with [a really annoying Android-specific bug](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/CUSTOM_INTERPOLATIONS.md#android).\n* Even though the new layouts have been created with horizontal carousels in mind, they will also work with vertical ones \\o/\n\n### Custom interpolations\n\nOn top of the new layouts, we've exposed the logic we used so that users can create their own awesome layouts! If you're interested, take a deep breath and see [the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/CUSTOM_INTERPOLATIONS.md).\n\nHere are two examples of what can easily be achieved (you can explore [the source code](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/example/src/utils/animations.js) and try it live in [the provided example](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/tree/master/example)):\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel custom layout](https://i.imgur.com/slnTbyG.gif)\n![react-native-snap-carousel custom layout](https://i.imgur.com/OrdLsCM.gif)\n\n## `ParallaxImage` component\n\nVersion `3.0.0` introduced a `<ParallaxImage />` component, an image component aware of carousel's current scroll position and therefore able to display a nice parallax effect.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this component [here](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/PARALLAX_IMAGE.md).\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel parallax image](https://i.imgur.com/6iIb4SR.gif)\n\n## `Pagination` component\n\nStarting with version `2.4.0`, a customizable `<Pagination />` component has been added. This is how it looks like with its default configuration:\n\nYou can find the documentation for this component [here](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/PAGINATION.md).\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel pagination](https://i.imgur.com/FLQcGGL.gif)\n\n## Example\nYou can find the following example in the [`/example` folder](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/tree/master/example).\n\n![react-native-snap-carousel](https://i.imgur.com/pZincya.gif)\n\n## Tips and tricks\n\nAll the useful tips and tricks have been gathered [here](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/TIPS_AND_TRICKS.md) - there is a bunch of them, which makes **this section a must-read!**\n\n## Known issues\n\n**Make sure to read about [the known issues](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before opening a new one**; you may find something useful.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] Add more examples\n- [ ] Handle different items' width/height\n- [X] Implement different layouts and allow using custom interpolations\n- [X] Implement both `FlatList` and `ScrollView` handling\n- [X] Add the ability to provide custom items animation\n- [X] Implement 'loop' mode\n- [X] Improve Android's behavior\n- [x] Add parallax image component\n- [x] Base the plugin on `FlatList` instead of `ScrollView`\n- [x] Add alignment option\n- [x] Add pagination component\n- [x] Add vertical implementation\n- [x] Handle device orientation event (see [this note](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/doc/TIPS_AND_TRICKS.md#handling-device-rotation))\n- [x] Add RTL support\n- [x] Improve momemtum handling\n- [x] Improve snap on Android\n- [x] Handle passing 1 item only\n- [x] Fix centering\n\n## Credits\n\nWritten by [Benoît Delmaire](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/benoitdelmaire) ([bd-arc](https://github.com/bd-arc)) and [Maxime Bertonnier](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/maxime-bertonnier-744351aa) ([Exilz](https://github.com/Exilz)) at\n[Archriss](http://www.archriss.com/).\n",
